This repo provides all details to repertory and validate the paper: Conformational Transition of TRPV5 Induced by Mechanical Force.

1.TRPV_CG folder contains topology, .mdp and .gro file to generate .tpr files to perform simulation with TRPV CG model

2.Preparation folder contains topology, .mdp and .gro file to generate .tpr files to perform simulation with TRPV-membrane-water system model and run MD simulations.

3.TRPV5_PILL contains .mdp file and .dat file to run steered molecular dynamics simulations and use the WHAM procedure for the computation of PMF.

4.Data and Script contains .sh, .xvg and .dat file which used to monitor distances and angles to get data.
